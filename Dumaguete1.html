        <p>Dumaguete is the perfect place to satisfy your hunger for exploration or relaxation. This laid-back Philippine destination with a rich history also has easy access to beaches and islands. It is known as "The City of Gentle People" because of the kind-hearted nature of its locals. It was also known to be a place where pirates come and visit during pre-Spanish colonization. It is where the city got its name from the word "dagit," a Cebuano word which means "to snatch." It is sitting at the foot of Cuernos de Negros or Mount Talinis in the Philippine province of Negros Oriental in the Visayas. The peaceful coastal community is a well-known spot for retirement, especially for expats. It was listed by Forbes Magazine as one of the 7 Best Places to Retire Around the World because it offers beachfront living that is relatively cheaper than other places in the world. The almost year-round hot and humid Dumaguete island weather is also perfect for daily trips to the beach.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the economy in the city has improved. Aside from the leading institutions, a lot of BPO and I.T. companies have settled here. Due to the multiple activities and attractions highlighting the city, tourism is also booming in the region. </p>
